## Todo-list

Main goal is to have this portfolio sufficient enough to be shared on LinkedIn by Wednesday, 11/23/22

### Primary:

- [ ] Color palette
- [ ] Create some basic 'hero section' (should be extremely simple for now, just to meet deadline — can make a better one later)
- [ ] Update bio contents with things removed from projects/skills
- [ ] Header: Fix scroll functionality and width issues
- [ ] SingleProject: Force scroll when expanding/collapsing (may need `isExpanded` to simply toggle `hidden` on a div)

### Secondary:

- [ ] Test and fix mobile view
- [ ] Find new font
- [ ] Contact component: styling changes
- [ ] Gradient to lighter color at bottom of page (maybe)
- [ ] Create favicon.ico
- [ ] Add favicon/title to header

<details>
<summary>Backburner</summary>

- [ ] User must expand projects to see images — this needs to be redesigned asap
- [ ] Create new, improved 'hero section'; ideally using `@react-three/fiber`
- [ ] Add links ~~and logos~~ for technologies
- [ ] Slider/carousel-type component for technologies (possibly)

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>Outdated</summary>

- [x] ~~Remove unused images~~
- [x] ~~Header: add scroll functionality; keep on top~~
- [x] Reformat skills content (in progress)
- [x] ~~Update project description formatting and content~~

</details> -->
