## Todo-list

Main goal is to have this portfolio sufficient enough to be shared on LinkedIn by 11/23/22 (Wednesday)

<details>
<summary>Primary</summary>

- [ ] Test and fix mobile view
- [ ] Color palette (in progress)
- [ ] Create basic 'hero section' (should be extremely simple — maybe just the bio — to meet deadline; can make a better one later)
- [x] ~~Update bio contents with things removed from projects/skills~~
- [ ] Header: Fix scroll functionality and width issues
- [ ] User must expand projects to see images — this needs to be redesigned asap

</details>

<details>
<summary>Secondary</summary>

- [ ] Clicking images expands with popup
- [ ] Contact links on bottom of 'hero'
- [x] ~~Find new font(s)~~
- [ ] Contact component: styling changes
- [ ] Gradient to lighter color at bottom of page (maybe)
- [ ] Create favicon.ico
- [ ] Add favicon/title to header

</details>

<details>
<summary>Backburner</summary>

- [ ] Create new, improved 'hero section'; ideally using `@react-three/fiber`
- [ ] Add links ~~and logos~~ for technologies
- [ ] Slider/carousel-type component for technologies (possibly)

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>Outdated</summary>

- [ ] Never make a project with CRA ever again :)
- [x] ~~Remove unused images~~
- [x] ~~Header: add scroll functionality; keep on top~~
- [x] Reformat skills content (in progress)
- [x] ~~Update project description formatting and content~~
- [x] ~~SingleProject: Force scroll when expanding/collapsing (removing 'isExpanded' concept entirely)~~

</details> -->
