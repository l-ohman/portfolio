## Todo-list

Main goal is to have this portfolio sufficient enough to be shared on LinkedIn by 11/25/22 (Friday)

<details>
<summary>Primary</summary>

- [x] ~~Test and fix mobile view~~
- [ ] Make adjustments for desktop (and tablet) view (all sections — especially hero)
- [x] ~~Color palette~~ (good enough for now, but needs tweaking)
- [x] ~~Create basic 'hero section' (should be extremely simple — maybe just the bio — to meet deadline; can make a better one later)~~
- [x] ~~Update bio contents with things removed from projects/skills~~
- [ ] Header: Fix scroll functionality ~~and width issues~~
- [x] ~~User must expand projects to see images — this needs to be redesigned asap~~

</details>

<details>
<summary>Secondary</summary>

- [ ] Clicking images expands with popup
- [ ] Hover shows alt text (or some helpful info)
- [x] ~~Contact links on bottom of 'hero'~~
- [x] ~~Find new font(s)~~
- [x] ~~Contact component: styling changes~~
- [ ] Create favicon.ico
- [ ] Add favicon/title to header
- [ ] Update project descriptions/contributions to account for formatting changes

</details>

<details>
<summary>Backburner</summary>

- [ ] Create new, improved 'hero section'; ideally using `@react-three/fiber`
- [ ] Add links ~~and logos~~ for technologies

</details>

<!-- <details>
<summary>Outdated</summary>

- [ ] Never make a project with CRA ever again :)
- [x] ~~Remove unused images~~
- [x] ~~Header: add scroll functionality; keep on top~~
- [x] Reformat skills content (in progress)
- [x] ~~Update project description formatting and content~~
- [ ] ~~SingleProject: Force scroll when expanding/collapsing (removing 'isExpanded' concept entirely)~~
- [ ] ~~Gradient to lighter color at bottom of page (maybe)~~
- [x] Add hero image to mobile view somehow (such as bar with contact links)
- [ ] ~~Slider/carousel-type component for technologies (possibly)~~
