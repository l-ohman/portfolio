This project had two main goals: the first was to enable students’ creativity by giving them a platform to create, and the second was to provide instructors with the tools necessary to monitor and manage their students’ works.",
        "I was responsible for the interface through which students create and edit their own books, as well as the database structure that supports it. Due to the complex nature of our relational database, I also wrote a great deal of tests to ensure that the books and pages worked as intended as we made changes throughout the project. This experience helped me understand how valuable test-driven development can be, even when on a short schedule."

The vast majority of my time on this project was spent designing and building the frontend. At the very beginning of the project, I drew the wireframes for nearly every page; these proved to be invaluable, as they greatly sped up our process and ensured visual consistency throughout the entire application. Once we had built the foundation for each page, I revised much of the styling and added subtle animations to construct a user experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and extremely clear."

Additionally, they can alter various parameters on the bodies in their solar system, such as size, color, orbit distance, and orbit speed.",
