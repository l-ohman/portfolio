      <p>
        I am a Fullstack Software Engineer from Texas. As a recent graduate of
        Fullstack Academy, I am very curious and excited to work on new projects
        â€” especially those related to music, mathematics, and outer space. My
        main goal at the moment is to learn and grow as a developer as much as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        My main priorities are accessibility and maintainability. When working
        on the user-side of things, I prioritize simplicity and clarity; but on
        the developer-side, I focus on writing readable code that can be easily
        understood and revised by the next developer.
