      "Umami Meats is an ecommerce site that sells a small variety of high-quality steak and sushi. This project was built in roughly 10 days for the 'Grace Shopper' project at Fullstack Academy.",
      "The vast majority of my time on this project was spent designing and building the frontend. At the very beginning of the project, I drew the wireframes for nearly every page; these proved to be invaluable, as they greatly sped up our process and ensured visual consistency throughout the entire application. Once we had built the foundation for each page, I revised much of the styling and added subtle animations to construct a user experience that is both aesthetically pleasing and extremely clear."

This project had two main goals: the first was to enable students’ creativity by giving them a platform to create, and the second was to provide instructors with the tools necessary to monitor and manage their students’ works."
